Pycraft is an OpenGL, OpenWorld, Video Game made entirely with Python. This project is a test to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message me if you have any feedback! <br />
Made with Python 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

### This is Pycraft-Insider-Preview, if you're looking for Pycraft, then the latest stable releases are under the Releases section of this repository, here: https://github.com/PycraftDeveloper/Pycraft/releases Pycraft may be unstable if trying to use the project from this branch, this is a snapshot of Pycraft v0.9.4.

Progress towards Pycraft v0.9.4 (Including documentation): ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/24)

## About
Pycraft is a 3D open-source, open-world video game made in Python. For a long time attempts to make large 3D games in python has been ignored, I believe there are two reasons: one; People use Python primarily for data handling and processing and not graphics and, two; there is little to no documentation out there to do anything more than make a 3D rotating cube in Python. Making a 3D game in Python for me hasn’t been an easy experience, far from it but I have decided to share my project, complete with tutorials, explanations, articles and code explanations in the hope that 3D game development in Python can be seen as a more easily attainable target, and to fill that gap in documentation. Pycraft then is a trial project, as I learn and experiment on what goes best where and how thing go together, this is why development can sometimes appear to have stopped, because I’m learning and testing what I've learned, so hopefully for people in the future it will be an easier experience. Also, don’t forget there is more to game development than just graphics, there is AI, sound, physics and all the other GUIs that go with it, and as I learn the quality of the overall program will improve. Pycraft is not going to be the final name of the game, however until something better becomes available, we shall stick to it.

## Preview Video
Here is a YouTube link to a showcase of Pycraft v0.9.1 (Developer Build): (https://youtu.be/shAprkrcaiI)

## Setup
When setting up and installing this project you can either run the bare bones file which is likely found above this 'README.md' file if your viewing this on the GitHub website then please follow the steps below for more information on the setup and installation of this project however where possible it is recommended that you use the executable file (.exe) under the most recent releases page as this will run regardless of where you place the file or if you have python or even if you have any of the installed modules this project depends on because its compiled into one file (hence the larger file size). which makes removing the file much easier and also sharing and transporting the file easier and more convenient. However, if you are planning to use the project in its uncompiled format (which as mentioned will be at the top of this page if you are on the GitHub website) then it is recommended you follow the below steps to make sure the project works properly.

The project will download as a (.zip) compressed file. Please make sure you have the project decompressed before use. Next make sure that any folders and files outside of the 'Pycraft' folder are removed and that the 'Pycraft' file is in the intended place for the file to be run from. This file can be freely moved around, transported between drives, computers and folders in this form. A video guide to this will be uploaded here and in YouTube in the coming months.

When running the program please make sure you have a minimum of 1GB of free space on the drive and also have Python 3 installed on your device. This can be found here: (www.python.org/downloads). The sub version of Python isn't too important in this circumstance however the project has been tested in Python 3.7 and above and is known to work. In addition to all this please make sure you have the following modules installed on your device: <br />
Pillow, Pygame, PyOpenGL, PyOpenGL-Accelerate, Moderngl, Moderngl-window, Numpy, PyAutoGUI, Psutil, PyWaveFront, Py-Cpuinfo, Gputil, Tabulate. 

_Please note that the use of PyOpenGL and PyOpenGL-Accelerate are being phased out, and they can be difficult to install; we recommend downloading the appropriate version from here: (https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs)_
For those not familiar they can be found here: (pypi.org) and you can use the following syntax to install, update and remove these modules:
```
pip install <module>
pip uninstall <module>
```

Here is a short video tutorial explain all this (It’s really not too bad), this is the link to the YouTube video: (youtu.be/DG5YbE-umw0)

## Running The Program
When running the program, you will either have a (.exe) file, downloaded from the releases page, or you will have the developer preview, if you have the developer preview, which can be found in the files section of this repository then this is how you run that program. Pycraft has recently undergone some large structural redesigning, so to run the program the advice is now different:

Now you have the program properly installed hopefully (you’ll find out if you haven’t promptly!) you need to locate the file "main.py" basically all this program does is run the right modules, initiates the main program, and catches any errors that might arise in the program in a nicely rendered error screen, if it crashes on your first run then chances are you haven’t installed the program correctly, if it still doesn’t work then you can drop me an email @ "ThomasJebbo@gmail.com" or comment here on the repository, I do hope however that it works alright for you and you have a pleasant experience. I might also add this program has been developed on a Windows 64-bit computer however should run fine on a 32-bit Windows machine (uncompiled) or through MacOS although they remain untested for now. 

I recommend creating a shortcut for the "main.py" file too so it’s easier to locate.

## Uncompiled Pycraft Dependencies <br />
When you’re installing the uncompiled Pycraft variant from here you need to install the following 'modules', which can be done through your Control Panel in Windows (First; press the windows key + r then type "cmd" then run the below syntax) or on Apple systems in Terminal.

```
pip install <module>
pip uninstall <module>
```
pip is usually installed by default when installing Python with most versions.

## Changes
Pycraft v0.9.4-1 is now live! Here is a list of all the added features to this pre-public release: <br />

* Feature - The error screen has been re-designed, with more features coming in the next snapshot.
* Feature - Most of the errors in Pycraft now have been given more information so that debugging is easier.
* Feature - Devmode captions have been added into the 3D game-engine.
* Feature - Work on the documentation.
* Feature - The benchmark GUI has had some processing optimisations and the file for the read test has been tweaked from 'Mebibytes' to 'Megabytes'.
* Bug-fix - The delays with transitioning between the 2D and 3D games engine have been fixed.
* Bug-fix - There have been many more bug-fixes, these will be detailed in the complete change-log with the release of Pycraft v0.9.4

_Please note there have been features REMOVED from this update at this point in time, for example the new load-screen, this will be re-added hopefully, but will take some time to work on. Also, there will likely be a small update to Pycraft over the course of December, however this will be likely bug fixes and the arrival/integration of the upcoming installer._

Again, feedback would be much appreciated this update was released on; 29/12/2021 (UK date) DD/MM/YYYY. As always, we hope you enjoy this new release and feel free to leave feedback.

## Update Timeline
Pycraft will be continually updated for a long time yet. The next few releases, Pycraft v0.9.x will not feature as a (.exe) release but only as a code release. Pycraft will now updated gradually, not all in one go, however (.exe) releases will likely only occur at major releases like the upcoming Pycraft v0.10! The following plan was taken from my medium article: How We are Making a Video Game in Python #2 (here: https://medium.com/@PycraftDev/how-we-are-making-a-video-game-in-python-2-547b504bbd67) <br />

At present this looks to be the schedule for Pycraft updates: <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.4 - This update, which is being worked on now, will feature the start of a documentation worked on here: https://python-pycraft.readthedocs.io/en/pycraft-v0.9.3/ (be aware, this link will change), and here on GitHub (over at the official releases under the wiki tab). This update also features the integration of the new installer which shall guide you through the installation process.
* Pycraft v0.9.5 — Will add better lighting, as well as a sun to the game! This update will also include the introduction of day and night cycles (20 minutes from sunset to sunrise), including clouds and dynamic skyboxes (featuring stars and night and day scenes). <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.6 — This will add weather events to the sky box, as well as updated sounds, including libraries for night sounds, day sounds, rain sounds, snow sounds, ambient music, footstep sounds on wet ground, footstep sounds on snow, hurt sounds, civilisation sounds, ocean sounds, and environmental sounds (like trees and grass). <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.7 — This will add an ocean to the OpenGL environment, as well as hopefully fixed collisions and much improved frame rates in game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.8 — This update will add structures (like buildings, trees, grass, boats, people) to the game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.9 — This update will feature interactions with the objects added in the previous update. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.10 — This update will feature the addition of a story line to the game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.11 — This update will feature a start position in game, as well as saving your progress and loading them on a start screen, this update will also begin the process of playthrough! <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.12 — This update will feature a GUI, as well as an in-game character! <br />
* Pycraft v0.10 — This update is set to be released in Spring of 2022 at the earliest! This will showcase all the sub-updates to Pycraft v0.9, as well as featuring a compiled version. This update will also improve upon features added in sub-updates, as well as improving performance, and lots of bug fixes. <br />
* Pycraft v0.10.1 — This update will feature the addition of inventory items. <br />
* Pycraft v0.10.2 — This update will feature improvements to the inventory and map GUIs, this is as far as the plan reaches so far! <br />

## Our Update Policy
New releases will be introduced regularly, it is likely that there will be some form of error or bug, therefore unless you intend to use this project for development and feedback purposes (Thank you all!) we recommend you use the latest stable release; below is how to identify the stable releases.

## Version Naming
Versions have changed pretty dramatically the past few days, don’t panic I'm here to help! In sort the new version naming system more closely follows the Semantic Naming system:
For example; Pycraft v0.9.2.1 The first number is relevant to if the project is in a finished state. The second number relates to the number of updates Pycraft has had. The third number relates to smaller sub-updates (that likely will not feature a (.exe) release). The last number there is rarely used, this is typically for PyPi releases only, as we can't edit uploaded version of the project, we use this number if there is an important change to the project description, those updates will not include any code changing!

## Releases
All past versions of Pycraft are available under the releases section of Pycraft, this is a new change, but; just as before, major releases like Pycraft v0.9 and Pycraft v0.8 will have (.exe) releases, but smaller sub-releases will not, this is in light of a change coming to Pycraft, this should help with the confusion behind releases, and be more accommodating to the installer that's being worked on as a part of Pycraft v0.9.4. This brings me on to another point, all past updates to Pycraft will be located at the releases page (Thats all versions), and the previous section on the home-page with branches will change. The default branch will be the most recent release, then there will be branches for all the sub-releases to Pycraft there too; and the sister program; Pycraft-Insider-Preview will be deprecated and all data moved to relevant places in this repository, this should hopefully cut down on the confusion and make the project more user-friendly.

## The Planned Storyline
In Pycraft the plan is that you will start at sea on a boat, there you will learn that you have left your home on a separate island to find work and safety on this new one, when you arrive, you are shown to your room and the next day join a small groups of trainee knights, each training to be part of the Royal Guards system that protects the island from the dangers on the island, you quickly rise in rank as your skills shine until one day all your skills are put to the test. Will you follow through? Well, you don't know yet, I've got to make the game first!

## Other Sources
I have started writing an article on medium which is released at the start of every month, this compliments the weekly updates that are posted on my twitter profile, it would be greatly appreciated if you wanted to check it out here at this link: (https://medium.com/@PycraftDev), these articles are also uploaded to my other account on Dev here: (https://dev.to/pycraftdev). Any recommendations and feedback are, as always, greatly appreciated, a lot of time and work goes into making this happen!

## Final Notices
Thank you greatly for supporting this project simply by running it, I am sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes. The programs will be updated frequently and I shall do my best to keep this up to date too. I also want to add that you are welcome to view and change the program and share it with your friends however please may I have some credit, just a name would do and if you find any bugs or errors, please feel free to comment in the comments section any feedback so I can improve my program, it will all be much appreciated and give as much detail as you wish to give out. BY INSTALLING THIS PROJECT ONTO YOUR COMPUTER AND RUNNING IT I; Tom Jebbo DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES THIS MAY CAUSE HOWEVER UNLIKELY, AND YOU AGREE TO HAVE EXTERNAL MODULES INSTALLED ONTO YOUR COMPUTER (WHEN NOT CHOOSING THE RECOMMENDED EXECUTABLE VERSION) ALSO, OF WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL OVER, PLEASE USE THIS PROGRAM RESPONSIBLY AND DO NOT USE IT TO CAUSE HARM. YOU MUST ALSO HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE DEVICES MANAGER OR ADMINISTRATOR TO INSTALL AND USE COMMAND PROMPT OR TERMINAL. NO DATA THIS PROGRAM COLLECTS IS STORED ANYWHERE BUT, ON YOUR DEVICE, AND AT ANY POINT NO CONNECTION TO A NETWORK IS REQUIRED, ALTHOUGH PERMISSION IS REQUESTED TO CHECK FOR UPDATES, ALTHOUGH THIS CAN BE DENIED.
