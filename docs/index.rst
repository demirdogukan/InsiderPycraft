Python-Pycraft's documentation
====================


Pycraft is an OpenGL, OpenWorld, Video Game made entirely with Python. This project is a test to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message me if you have any feedback!
Made with Python 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
